# How to create website using Forestry - Hugo - Git - Netlify 

This repo is for creating websites using Forestry, Hugo, Github and Netlify. The document below explains the role of each of this component, the complete pipeline and how to make changes. 

This is based of the [Forestry Hugo Starter Template](https://github.com/forestryio/novela-hugo-starter) and the theme we use is the Novela theme. 

## Hugo Novela Forestry Starter

A port of [Narative](https://www.narative.co/)'s Gatsby theme [Novela](https://www.narative.co/labs/novela/)

</a>

## Prerequisites

- Hugo > 0.55.0

## Content Management

![Forestry user interface](images/novela-forestry.png)

This project has been pre-configured to work with [Forestry](https://forestry.io), just import your repository âœ¨. \
Any changes you make will be commited back to the repo, and deployed if you're using Netlify.

## Deployment and hosting with Netlify

For automatically deploying to netlify, there is a netlify.toml file included in the base of the repo, which is used for running the build commands. 


**Alternatively**, you can import your site into Netlify and configure the build command. 

Import your site in [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

1. Create a new site in Netlify and import your repository.
2. Set the build command to: `hugo --gc --minify`
3. Set the publish directory to: `public`
4. Make sure to set `HUGO_VERSION` to 0.55.0 or above (tested with 0.62.2)

That's it, now your site gets deployed automatically on `git push` or when saving documents from Forestry.

## Development

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:forestryio/novela-hugo-starter.git

# cd in the project directory
cd novela-hugo-starter

# Start local dev server
hugo server
```

For more information, see [official Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/).

## Customization

### Logo

Add to your projects layout directory your logo's SVG:
`/layouts/icons/ui/logo.html`

### Socials

In order for the Socials to be surfaced in Forestry, you should copy the theme's `config/_default/social.yaml` to your project.

### Authors

You should register authors as a taxonomy in your project's `config.yaml``

```yaml
taxonomies:
  author: authors
```

#### Creating authors

Add a similar file to your content directory and Front Matter example.

```yaml
# /content/authors/firstname-lastname/_index.md
---

  joys and of course, your Twitter handle.
